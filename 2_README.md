## Apostilled Birth Certificate
An Apostille is a certificate that authenticates the signature of a public official on a document for use in another country. An Apostille certifies:

- the authenticity of the signature of the public official who signed the document,
- the capacity in which that public official acted, and
- when appropriate, the identity of the seal or stamp which the document bears, e.g. a notary public seal.

The Apostille does **not** validate the contents of the document. 

### Obtaining an Apostille in California
_The following information is gathered from the website of the [California Secretary of State](https://www.sos.ca.gov). Please refer to your state's website for specific instructions on who, when, where and how to obtain an apostille._

The California Secretary of State provides an Apostille to authenticate California public officials' signatures on documents to be used outside the United States of America. Any individual can request an Apostille. When requesting an Apostille in person, no person(s) named in the document must be present. Additionally, the requester does not need to be related to any person(s) named in the document.

For birth and death certificates, the California Secretary of State can issue an Apostille for the signatures of:
- county clerks and their deputies,
- county recorders and their deputies, and
- the State Registrar (California Department of Public Health).

If your birth or death certificate was issued by a city- or county-level agency and has the signature of a Health Officer or County Registrar (e.g. Local Registrar, Registrar of Vital Records), prior to presenting to the office of the Secretary of State for authentication, one of the following will be required:
- have that birth or death certificate certified by the county clerk’s office in the county in which it was issued, or
- obtain a certified copy of that birth or death certificate from the county recorder or State of California Department of Public Health.

The signature, name, and title of the public official can be found at the bottom of a birth or death certificate.

#### Ways to obtain an Apostille
There are two ways to obtain an Apostille in California:

- By Mail - An Apostille can be requested by mail through the Secretary of State's Sacramento office.
- In Person - An Apostille can be requested in person at the Secretary of State's Sacramento and Los Angeles offices. For an in-person request, the document can be either picked up from their office, or a label can be included for delivery to your home.

Please refer to [this](https://www.sos.ca.gov/notary/request-apostille) page for detailed intructions. <br>
_Tip: Before choosing either option, check [this](https://www.sos.ca.gov/notary/processing-times/) page to see the current processing times. Typically, in-person apostille requests are processed faster than mail-in requests._
